## File permissions

In Linux, everything is a file. Directories are files, devives are files. 
Only Super user or "root" can access any file.

| Permission | Action | chmod option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| read | (view) | r or 4 |
| write | (edit) | w or 2 |
| execute | (execute) | x or 1 |

| User | ls output |
| --- | --- |
| owner | -rwx------ |
| group | ----rwx--- |
| other | -------rwx |

Directories have Folder/directory permission

| Permission | Action | chmod option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| read | (view contents, i.e. ls command) | r or 4 |
| write | (create or remove files from dir) | w or 2 |
| execute | (cd into directory) | x or 1
